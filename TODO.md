# TODO

Some important things that need to be done, not in any particular order. Items tagged with (1.0) are todos that need to be compled before the 1.0 release.

### Todo

- [ ] (1.0) Improve the API, (names, return structs, cleanup, organize different APIs, docs?)
- [ ] (1.0) Minimise the use of clone() along the codebase.

- [ ] (1.0) "Files" page. See the team page in the tauri branch for how this is supossed to be implemented. That implmentation uses too many api calls and could probably be improved using graph api.
- [ ] (1.0) Improve the chat page.
- [ ] Team "Tabs" support, i.e the little options under the title of a team in Team's team page. For example "Home Page" or "Classwork" or "Class Notebook"
- [ ] Assignments page
- [ ] Support for more message types. For example "card" or the meeting type.
- [ ] Support for more activity types.
- [ ] (1.0) Fix glitched/wrong emojis.
- [ ] Progressively load messages in team conversations to improve load performance.
- [ ] Improve message rendering.
- [ ] Progressively load chat conversations.
