# Squads
Squads aims to be a minimalist alternative to the official Microsoft Teams client.
Because of major api differences in Teams, Squads only works with accounts that are part of an organization, such as school or work accounts.

⚠️ Still in early development: expect things to be broken and the code unfinished ⚠️

## Run
Install and add chromedriver to path. Chromedriver is only used for logging in with Teams.
```
cargo run 
```
